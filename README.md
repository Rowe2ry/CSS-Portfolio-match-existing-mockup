# Advanced CSS Portfolio Page
A version of my portfolio laid out to a pre-defined mockup created by an outside source.

## How to access project

[CSS Portfolio Page](https://rowe2ry.github.io/CSS-Portfolio-match-existing-mockup/)

## Usage:

This page is a portfolio of some of my current favorite works. The center focus project is my full-stack online automotive school project, Overdrive. The other featured projects are mostly various Javascript projects that were done as educational exercises. It should be noted that the styling of this page has been **done in such a way to match a given mockup as part of a challenge given to me** . These colors, layout, and effects are chosen to match a given layout, and are not necessarily representative of my chosen aesthetic (though I do think it all looks quite nice myself).

# Advanced CSS Portfolio Page
A version of my portfolio laid out to a pre-defined mockup created by an outside source.

## How to access project

This project is deployed live on my GitHub. You can access it with the following link.

[CSS Portfolio Page](https://rowe2ry.github.io/CSS-Portfolio-match-existing-mockup/)

## Usage:

This page is a portfolio of some of my current favorite works. At the initial publish time, this portfolio contains artwork, a script I wrote to determine which characters in a given string are part of a hashtag, one refactoring project I have completed, a digital advertisement I created in graphic design software, and a Photographic coverage event I did for Mazda USA. As I continue to develop web projects in my journey to becoming a full stack web developer, I intend to update the projects listed here. It should be noted that the styling of this page has been **done in such a way to match a given mockup as part of a challenge given to me** . These colors, layout, and effects are chosen to match a given layout, and are not necessarily representative of my chosen aesthetic (though I do think it all looks quite nice myself).

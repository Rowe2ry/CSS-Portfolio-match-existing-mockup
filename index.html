                <p>
                    I am a developer looking to utilize my nine years in the graphic and digital print industry to branch into web development. I spent most of my teenage years honing skills as a photographer to familiarize myself with the Adobe Creative Suite softwares and digital imaging as a whole. After finishing school, I entered into the large format print space as a pre-press technician, production manager, and graphic designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my time with the print company, I found that we were asked to perform numerous tasks of varying complexity with much repetition. I started to teach myself Applescript to automate these repetitive tasks. It started off simple, such as short scripts that would generate a string with the current date in a particular format the company used on internal documentation. Or a script to create new folders with a set internal structure for each new customer job coming in. After a few years, I had scripts inputting and styling customer data into graphic art templates as well as generating print and cut files automatically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I had these tools developed and implemented, co-workers of mine were asking how they could run these scripts themselves. Or if I could map certain function keys on their keyboards to execute these scripts. I was only trying to save myself time, and suddenly <em>I had users running tools I built multiple times a day!</em> It was at this point I knew I had outgrown the print shop, and started my foray into web development. I know that my expert eye for design and layout on top of years of industry experience developing tools on the job make me a unique candidate capable of problem-solving under pressure.
